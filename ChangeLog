2.0.0 (2014-??-??)
	* Removed: Request::createFromPHPRequest. This is now handled by
	  Sapi::getRequest.

2.0.0alpha6 (2014-01-14)
	* Added: Asynchronous HTTP client. See examples/asyncclient.php.
	* Fixed: Issue #4: Don't escape colon (:) when it's not needed.
	* Fixed: Fixed a bug in the content negotation script.
	* Fixed: Fallback for when CURLOPT_POSTREDIR is not defined (mainly for
	  hhvm).

	  that serializes the objects into a standard HTTP message. This is mainly
	  for debugging purposes.
